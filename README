This MATLAB program calculates the steady state values of quasi 1D nozzle flow using MacCormack's technique. 

The reference for the algorithm is taken from the "computaional fluid dynamics " book by John D Andserson.

The geometry shape and initial values are taken from the reference book, to avoid blow-up of the solution.

The program calculates the values at each grid point using the MacCormack's technique.

Number of iterations are set to 2000. and the values are plotted on the graph.

The data  at each grid point is stored in a xlsx file, it can be used in determining the parameters at each point.
